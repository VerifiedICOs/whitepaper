## Whitepaper

### VICO Token

#### Abstract

This year we have witnessed the incredible rise of cryptocurrency prices, ICOs and blockchain projects. There is no doubt that the amount of news appearing in the media regarding Bitcoin has been rising exponentially, both good and bad. With all this excessive exposure comes the injection of fear and uncertanty into the crypto markets. Verified ICOs has continually been providing the community with unbiased fundamental and realistic analysis on multiple ICO projects. The Verified ICOs mission is to educate and help traders and investors make wiser decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency space. To help us acheive our mission, we have created the VICO token to give the community an opportunity to vote on what projects the Verified ICOs team should analyze.

# Consensus Model

VICO Vote Tokens will allow users to list an ICO on VerifiedICOs for a 7 day time period. Once a listing is created, VICO Vote Tokens can be used to contribute/vote on an ICO listing. The ICO with the highest contribution VICO Vote Token amount after the deadline will have that amount sent to VerifiedICOs as a form of payment for an in depth analysis and listing to be completed. ICO teams will have the opporunity to submit their ICO for analysis and list via an Ethereum Smart Contract. Investors will be able to use their tokens to vote which ICO project they would like to see a review on.

# Distribution

# Implementation

The listing process will be manually facilited by our staff until development can be satisfied.
