## Whitepaper

### VICO Token

#### Abstract

This year we have witnessed the incredible rise of cryptocurrency prices, ICOs and blockchain projects. There is no doubt that the amount of news appearing in the media regarding Bitcoin has been rising exponentially, both good and bad. With all this excessive exposure comes the injection of fear and uncertanty into the crypto markets. Verified ICOs has continually been providing the community with unbiased fundamental and realistic analysis on multiple ICO projects. The Verified ICOs mission is to educate and help traders and investors make wiser decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency space. To help us acheive our mission, we have created the VICO token to give the community an opportunity to vote on what projects the Verified ICOs team should analyze.

# Consensus Model

VICO Vote Tokens will allow users to list an ICO on VerifiedICOs.com for a 7 day time period. Once a listing is created, VICO Vote Tokens can be used further to contribute/vote on an ICO listing. The ICO with the highest contribution VICO Vote Token amount after the deadline will have that amount sent to VerifiedICOs in exchange for an in depth analysis and listing to be completed. ICO teams will have the opportunity to submit their ICO for analysis and listing via an Ethereum Smart Contract. We will facilitate the transactions using MetaMask to communicate with the Ethereum network.

# Implementation

Listings will be manually facilited by our staff until development can be satisfied to automate the listing process via Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network. Requests to create a voteable listing should be sent to us via Email for the time being.

The Verified ICOs platform is aimed to be completed by the end of January*.

*January is an ambitious goal and may not be met due to the nature of testing, debugging and development.

# Distribution

VICO Vote Tokens will be delivered to a ERC20 compatible wallet via airdrop to each qualified user that completes our survey. The number of tokens distributed to each user will vary based on the information provided within the survey. The distribution and qualification process may take several days depending on the number of claims we must process.
